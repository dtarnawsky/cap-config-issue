# Cap Config Issue
This app was created using the starter for Ionic with Capacitor integration and contains an iOS and Android folder.

@capacitor/project is installed

To show problem:
- `npm install`
- `npm run config`
- This runs `test\test.ts`
- The calls to `ios.getBuild` and `ios.getVersion` should not be undefined
